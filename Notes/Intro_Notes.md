# Intro

> It's a long, long journey  
Till I know where I'm supposed to be  
It's a long, long journey  
I don't know if I can believe  
When shadows fall and block my eyes  
I am lost and know that I must hide  
It's a long, long journey  
Till I find my way home to you  
...  
Many days I've spent  
Drifting on through empty shores  
Wondering what's my purpose  
Wondering how to make me strong  
I know I will falter I know I will cry  
I know you'll be standing by my side  
It's a long, long journey  
And I need to be close to you  
...  
Sometimes it feels no one understands  
I don't even know why I do the things I do  
When pride builds me up till I can't see my soul  
Will you break down these walls and pull me through  
...  
Cause It's a long, long journey  
Till I feel that I am worth the price  
You paid for me on calvary  
Beneath those stormy skies  
When Satan mocks and friends turn to foes  
It feel like everything is out to make me lose control  
Cause it's a long, long journey  
Till I find my way home to you, to you  
...

用歌词首句作为目录标题是我很久以来的习惯，只是这首怎么听都是“为赋新词强说愁”。求替换！
